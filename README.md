Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma Lab

## What?
This is a sandbox for running Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) tournaments, but with more flexibility and realism than the standard version.

## How?
Planned features (so far):
- **Engines**: Different modes to run simulations. Engines can bias the opponent pool, modify rounds (e.g. double rewards, asymmetric payoffs), both, or more.
- **Strategies**: A collection of strategies in one folder. Each strategy follows the same function signature so they can be auto-loaded into tournaments.
- **Data Export**: CSV/data sheet export for results. (Visual outputs would be cool too.)
- **UI**: Starting with a text-based interface. Maybe a graphical one later if I’m bored.

## Why?
Because the “vanilla” IPD is neat, but not quite like real life.
Also I'm an introvert trying to learn socialization without the socialization part.
